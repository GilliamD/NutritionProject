                        <p>Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water, meaning they also dissolve quickly in your body. Unlike fat-soluble vitamins, water-soluble vitamins cannot be stored in the body, though they are carried to the body's tissues, which is why we need to make sure we take these vitamins on a regular basis. Excess amounts of these vitamins simply pass through the body.</p>

                        <p>Fat-soluble vitamins are named as such because they are stored in the body's fatty tissue. These vitamins are stored in the body for a long periods of time, thus pose a greater risk when the foods that contain them are consumed in excess. Generally, you won't really have to worry about this in a regular diet, but taking pill supplements that contain high doses of these vitamins may lead to complications. There are some health problems, such as IBD, chronic pancreatitis, and cystic fibrosis, that may reduce the bodies absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Consult your doctor if any of these conditions apply to you.</p>

                        <p>Your body needs two types of minerals to function normally; major minerals and trace minerals. The classifications of the minerals aren't based on how important they are, but how prevalent they are throughout your body. Meaning, major minerals, such as calcium, chloride, magnesium,phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and sulfur, are found in large amounts in your body; while trace minerals such as chromium, copper, fluoride, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and zinc, are found in very small quantities throughout the body.</p>

        <p class="has-text-justified">Protein is crucial to good health. In fact, the name comes from the Greek word <em>proteos</em>, meaning “primary” or “first place. Proteins are made up of amino acids that join together to form long chains. You can think of a protein as a string of beads in which each bead is an amino acid. There are 20 amino acids that help form the thousands of different proteins in your body.</p>

Under normal circumstances, your body breaks down the same amount of protein that it uses to build and repair tissues. Other times, it breaks down more protein than it can create, thus increasing your body’s needs.</p>

                            Some proteins are fibrous and provide cells and tissues with stiffness and rigidity. These proteins include keratin, collagen and elastin, which help form the connective framework of certain structures in your body. <br><br><strong>Keratin</strong> is a structural protein that is found in your skin, hair and nails. <br><br><strong>Collagen</strong> is the most abundant protein in your body and is the structural protein of your bones, tendons, ligaments and skin. <br><br><strong>Elastin</strong> is several hundred times more flexible than collagen. Its high elasticity allows many tissues in your body to return to their original shape after stretching or contracting, such as your uterus, lungs and arteries.

                            Protein plays a vital role in regulating the concentrations of acids and bases in your blood and other bodily fluids. A variety of buffering systems allows your bodily fluids to maintain normal pH ranges. A constant pH is necessary, as even a slight change in pH can be harmful or potentially deadly. One way your body regulates pH is with proteins. An example is hemoglobin, a protein that makes up red blood cells

                            Proteins regulate body processes to maintain fluid balance. Albumin and globulin are proteins in your blood that help maintain your body’s fluid balance by attracting and retaining water. If you don’t eat enough protein, your levels of albumin and globulin eventually decrease. Consequently, these proteins can no longer keep blood in your blood vessels, and the fluid is forced into the spaces between your cells. As the fluid continues to build up in the spaces between your cells, swelling or edema occurs, particularly in the stomach region.

                            Proteins help form immunoglobulins, or antibodies, to fight infection. Antibodies are proteins in your blood that help protect your body from harmful invaders like bacteria and viruses. Once your body has produced antibodies against a particular bacteria or virus, your cells never forget how to make them. As a result, your body develops immunity against the diseases to which it is exposed.

                        <p>Eating foods that contain saturated fats raises the level of cholesterol in your blood. High levels of LDL cholesterol in your blood increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. The American Heart Association recommends aiming for a dietary pattern that achieves 5% to 6% of calories from saturated fat. For example, if you need about 2,000 calories a day, no more than 120 of them should come from saturated fat. That’s about 13 grams of saturated fat per day. Saturated fats are typically solid at room temperature. Replacing foods that are high in saturated fat with healthier options can lower blood cholesterol levels and improve lipid profiles</p>

                            <p>There are two broad types of trans fats found in foods: naturally-occurring and artificial trans fats. Naturally-occurring trans fats are produced in the gut of some animals and foods made from these animals. Artificial trans fats (or trans fatty acids) are created in an industrial process that adds hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils to make them more solid. In November 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made a preliminary determination that partially hydrogenated oils are no longer Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) in human food. Trans fats raise your bad (LDL) cholesterol levels and lower your good (HDL) cholesterol levels. Eating trans fats increases your risk of developing heart disease and stroke. It’s also associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</p>

                            <p>Monounsaturated fats can have a beneficial effect on your heart when eaten in moderation and when used to replace saturated fat and trans fat in your diet. Monounsaturated fats can help reduce bad cholesterol levels in your blood which can lower your risk of heart disease and stroke. They also provide nutrients to help develop and maintain your body’s cells. Oils rich in monounsaturated fats also contribute vitamin E to the diet, an antioxidant vitamin most Americans need more of. While, all fats provide 9 calories per gram, monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats can have a positive effect on your health, when eaten in moderation.</p>

                                <p>Oils rich in polyunsaturated fats also provide essential fats that your body needs but can’t produce itself – such as omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids. You must get essential fats through food. Omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are important for many functions in the body. The four types have different chemical structures and physical properties. The bad fats, saturated and trans fats, tend to be more solid at room temperature (like a stick of butter), while monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats tend to be more liquid (like liquid vegetable oil).

                                When it comes to fat, there's one type you don't want to cut back on: omega-3 fatty acids. Two crucial ones -- EPA and DHA -- are primarily found in certain fish. ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), another omega-3 fatty acid, is found in plant sources such as nuts and seeds. Not only does your body need these fatty acids to function, but also they deliver some big health benefits.</p>

Just remember to choose foods that provide good fats (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) and balance the amount of calories you eat from all foods with the amount of calories you burn. Aim to eat a dietary pattern that emphasizes intake of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains; includes low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, legumes, non-tropical vegetable oils and nuts; and limits intake of sodium, sweets, sugar sweetened beverages and red meats. Doing so means that your diet will be low in both saturated fats and trans fats.</p>

                <p>Carbohydrates often get clumped together in two extreme categories: good and bad. Carbohydrates are the body’s primary source of energy. Everyone needs them, but it’s important to known which ones are good for you and which ones aren’t. Often referred to as simple and complex carbohydrates, the three types of carbs — sugar, starch, and fiber — all have a place in your diet. Simple carbohydrates are monosaccharides and disaccharides, while starches and fiber are polysaccharides.</p>

                <p class="title">Carbohydrate Basics</p>
                <p>Carbohydrates are classified according to their chemical structure. Monosaccharides are the simplest form of carbs. They are glucose, fructose, and galactose. Glucose is commonly referred to as blood sugar and naturally occurs in fruits and sweeteners. Fructose is fruit sugar and is also the sugar in honey and vegetables. Galactose helps form lactose. Disaccharides are sugars that will eventually be broken down into monosaccharides. They contain two carbohydrates linked together. Sucrose, lactose, and maltose are disaccharides. Sucrose is plain table sugar, lactose is the sugar found in milk, and maltose is found in germinating grains. Polysaccharides are the most complex of carbohydrates. They are the starches and fiber in the diet. They are made of many monosaccharides joined together.</p>

                                <p>The primary role of carbohydrates is to supply energy to all cells in the body. Some cells, such as red blood cells, are only able to produce cellular energy from glucose. The brain is also highly sensitive to low blood-glucose levels because it uses only glucose to produce energy and function (unless under extreme starvation conditions). About 70 percent of the glucose entering the body from digestion is redistributed (by the liver) back into the blood for use by other tissues.</p>

                                <p>If the body already has enough energy to support its functions, the excess glucose is stored as glycogen (the majority of which is stored in the muscle and liver). The amount of glycogen in the body at any one time is equivalent to about 4,000 kilocalories—3,000 in muscle tissue and 1,000 in the liver. Prolonged muscle use (such as exercise for longer than a few hours) can deplete the glycogen energy reserve. The liver, like muscle, can store glucose energy as a glycogen, but in contrast to muscle tissue it will sacrifice its stored glucose energy to other tissues in the body when blood glucose is low. The liver uses this glycogen reserve as a way to keep blood-glucose levels within a narrow range between meal times.</p>

                                <p>In a situation where there is not enough glucose to meet the body’s needs, glucose is synthesized from amino acids. Because there is no storage molecule of amino acids, this process requires the destruction of proteins, primarily from muscle tissue. The presence of adequate glucose basically spares the breakdown of proteins from being used to make glucose needed by the body.</p>

                                    <p>As blood-glucose levels rise, the use of lipids as an energy source is inhibited. Thus, glucose additionally has a “fat-sparing” effect. This is because an increase in blood glucose stimulates release of the hormone insulin, which tells cells to use glucose (instead of lipids) to make energy.</p>
